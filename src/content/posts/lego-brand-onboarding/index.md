I have had the opportunity to observe my kid's first experiences with Duplos, the toddler sized Lego bricks. The Duplo sets do not come packed with instructions leading me to believe that they have been designed to encourage learning the Lego rules and therefore making it easier to adopt the regular Lego bricks at a later age. By no means it is impossible to start building with Lego's at any age, however, I have witnessed older kids and adults alike having cumbersome first experiences with Legos. With such barrier for entry, it is hard to think Lego's as toys but rather as a medium of art, or in the case of this write up, a service.

TODO: What is onboarding?

As an experienced Lego builder, I had to break my own bias to the difficulty of Legos. I have thought that the rules are simple and following the instructions is easy. Especially for girls who have not been introduced to activities that train spatial skills[^1], even when following the instructions, it could take some time to get used to building with Legos. Additionally on average, the later in life you become a builder, the more difficult it is[^2]. This barrier of entry is comparable to art mediums, Legos can be used for creative purposes after all. However, the medium does have a relatively high cost and is governed by the Lego Group[^3] rendering it to a service, hence Lego has had to introduce various ways to retain their customers.

TODO: What are core skills customers need to learn to be onboarded?
TODO: Skip the layers in the following paragraph and let this section introduce them organically.

Lego bricks onboarding can be split in 2 phases, Duplos and Legos, and 3 layers, creative, tutorial and skill. The phases cover physical limitations and layers cover various types of builders. Additionally, the sets are age gated to have some control over the audience depending on the expected physical expectations.

The Duplo phase serves as the age appropriate entry point for builders aged between 1 and 5. The Lego bricks are quite small and we cannot realistically expect toddlers to have the fine motor skills to handle them. Duplos take the IDEO toddler toothbrush approach[^4] and given them big bricks that do not need fine motor skills. The Duplo sets do not come with instructions either encouraging the young builders to imitate the images or be creative[^5]. The lack of sets targeted for ages 3 and up suggests that the age group 3 to 5 is a transition period for Lego bricks which have the minimum age gate of 4. The Duplo sets for this group contain licensed ones like Frozen and DC Comics still serving as a great introduction for builders in the higher age group who are not ready to start with the smaller Lego bricks.

TODO: Creativity layer is missing from the following paragraph.

After the transition, the builders acquire a set of smaller Lego bricks. Luckily, these are mostly compatible with the Duplo collection keeping the investment[^6] still intact. The Duplo rules are inherited by Lego bricks but they also introduce new interesting pieces. In case the builder skipped the first phase, there is an instruction manual introducing all pieces and help you out with the Lego rules. As the sets' age gate goes higher, so will the intricacy of the sets matching the expected skill level.

TODO: Establish a "returning builder"

Lego bricks system has multiple entry points for newcomers as well as returning builders while ensuring that whatever new content (Lego set) triggered the entry, it is available with as low barrier as possible. Live operated games may experience this challenge especially when there is a reliance on new content. Let's take a deeper look into three systems that onboard Lego builders.

The success of Legos can be contributed to the intrinsic motivational driver: *creativity*. Creativity is established early with Duplos and is seen as the lack of instructions. The builder is encouraged to learn how to build and play with the bricks by imitating the image on the box or by parents' example. The approach is comparable to video games' that do not rely on explicit tutorials. Take for example the classic Super Mario games[^7]. The player is suggested a goal to the right without explicit instructions to do so. They are encouraged to explore the rules on their own and then use what they have learned to reach the goal.

As Lego sets target age group increases and the sets become more intricate, the reliance of creativity diminishes and the *instructions* booklets take place. The booklets help compensate for the lack of spontaneous creation and helps one to build that Star Wars space ship that looked very cool. In games, the booklet is comparable to a tutorial. Live games that introduce new features to the game often have a separate tutorial to introduce the feature, however, for returning users this is not enough as they may have forgotten some of the core rules. League of Legends rewrites the rules after each season[^8] making it unnecessary to remember the details as when you return, they have changed.

Late comers have an additional challenge, they do not have the *skills* that experienced builders have acquired from the years of building with Duplos and the other Lego sets. For this group, the instructions serve two purposes: teach the rules of Lego, and serve as a feedback system to not overwhelm the builder. Especially for the more intricate sets, the instructions are sectioned into smaller parts giving a set of smaller goals that serve the bigger goal[^9]. Completing each part would give a small motivational boost as well as improve the comprehension of the Lego rule set as each step shows how particular piece works. Of course the skills will not be acquired right away, but the instructions will help the new builder to get to the goal.

This is a tricky situation in live video games where new content is introduced regularly and cannot be set available from the get got. That would be like giving all the Lego sets in one go, overwhelming. The common way is to gate the content behind another, or in Lego terms, keep the cool Lego set locked up until some other ones have been built. This introduces a problem where the player has to spend time on other content before they get what they came for. This could mitigated by teasing the content like in Sim City: BuildIt, clan versus mode can be seen before it is unlocked. In Diablo series, a high level friend can "boost" another through the content so they can unlock the end game features. However, what if the player gets bored before unlocking the feature or does not have friends that can coach them?

The main reason to implement progression gates is to ensure that they have accumulated necessary skills to take on new challenges. However, this can be problematic as stated before. Perhaps we could learn from Lego on how to let new players take on the challenges as soon as possible. Perhaps the onboarding could be modular like the instruction set amd creative in the sense that the player is given freedom to tackle features as they see fit. Any features could be designed around a required skill set and the player would follow the steps to acquire them.

Mega Bloks, which may be the strongest competitor in the "building blocks" category, is around a tenth of the size of Lego Group. <https://beemlaw.com/billion-dollar-lego-patent/>
Mattel bought Mega Brands US$460 million in 2014
Lego was found more valuable than Mattel in 2013 at over 14 billion <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-13/lego-builds-new-billionaires-as-toymaker-topples-mattel.html>
This would put Mega Brands 3% the value of Lego in around 2014
