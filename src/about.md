Hello! My name is Dani Jompero. I am a passionate game designer with 8 years of game industry experience in game design, quality assurance and production.
  
My career started with helping game studios like Ubisoft, EA, Sony and Microsoft localize their game projects. I have since moved to Ubisoft RedLynx mobile quality assurance team and later production. I am now a game designer in the same team.
  
With the variety of experience in game industry, I have picked up the soft skills to work in a big and small teams as a member as well as a leader. I also have insight of the ins and out of game development from prototyping to development as well as dealing with outsourced teams and IP holders.
  
My journey is not over yet and I am learning and improving my skills everyday. I let this blog be my journal in the world game design. See you there!
